## Background

I will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimick the building of a real world backend service, which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

My database will be PSQL, and you will interact with it using [Knex](https://knexjs.org).

I will complete setup and seeding phase of this project, then build the server up!
